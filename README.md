These codes are intended to reproduce the results in the paper McClarren, R. G. (2019). Calculating Time Eigenvalues of the Neutron Transport Equation with Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Nuclear Science and Engineering, 193(8), 854â€“867. http://doi.org/10.1080/00295639.2018.1565014

The codes can take a while to run, so you might want to decrease I or N for your first run.
